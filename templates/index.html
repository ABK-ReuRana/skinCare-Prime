                        <ul>
                            <li>Avoid prolonged exposure to the sun, especially during peak hours (10 am to 4 pm).</li>
                            <li>Wear protective clothing, such as hats and long-sleeved shirts. </li>
                            <li>Avoid tanning beds and sunlamps.</li>
                            <li>Use sunscreen with an SPF of at least 30, and apply it 20-30 minutes before going
                                outside. Reapply every 2 hours or after swimming or sweating.</li>
                            <li>Be aware of any changes in your skin, such as new or changing moles, and consult a
                                dermatologist if you notice anything suspicious.</li>

                        <p>Basal cell carcinoma is a common variant of epithelial skin cancer that rarely metastasizes
                            but grows destructively if untreated. It appears in different morphologic variants (flat,
                            nodular, pigmented, cystic, etc).</p>
                        <h2> Prevention and control </h2>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Sun protection: Avoid prolonged sun exposure and protect your skin from harmful UV rays
                                by wearing protective clothing, hats, and sunglasses. Also, apply a broad-spectrum
                                sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher every two hours. </li>
                            <li>Quit smoking: Smoking can damage your skin and increase your risk of developing basal
                                cell carcinoma. Quitting smoking can lower your risk and improve your overall health.
                            </li>
                            <li>Seek medical attention: If you notice any suspicious spots or growths on your skin, seek
                                medical attention promptly. Your doctor can perform a biopsy and determine if it is
                                cancerous. Early detection and treatment can prevent the cancer from spreading and
                                improve your chances of a full recovery.</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Limit your time in the sun. Especially avoid time in the sun between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. And avoid staying in the sun so long that you get a sunburn or a suntan</li>
                            <li>Cover up. For extra protection from the sun, wear tightly woven clothing that covers your arms and legs. Also wear a broad-brimmed hat. This provides more protection than does a baseball cap or golf visor.</li>
                            <li>Check your skin regularly and report changes to your health care provider. Examine your skin regularly, looking for the development of new skin growths or changes in existing moles, freckles, bumps and birthmarks. With the help of mirrors, check your face, neck, ears and scalp. Examine the tops and undersides of your arms and hands.</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Keep your skin healthy: Good skin health is important for preventing dermatofibromas. This includes keeping your skin clean and moisturized, avoiding harsh soaps and other skin irritants, and maintaining a healthy diet and lifestyle.</li>
                            <li>Treat existing dermatofibromas: If you already have dermatofibromas, there are a few options for treatment. In some cases, the growths can be removed surgically. Other treatments may include cryotherapy (freezing the growths) or laser therapy.</li>
                            <li>See a dermatologist: If you are concerned about dermatofibromas or notice any unusual growths on your skin, it's important to see a dermatologist for an evaluation. A dermatologist can help diagnose the condition and provide treatment options.</li>

                        <p>Melanoma is a type of skin cancer that can be very dangerous if not detected and treated early. Melanoma is a malignant neoplasm derived from melanocytes that may appear in different variants. If excised in an early stage it can be cured by simple surgical excision. Melanomas can be invasive or non-invasive. We included all variants of melanoma including melanoma in situ, but did exclude non-pigmented, subungual, ocular or mucosal melanoma.</p>

                            <li>Check your skin regularly: Perform self-examinations of your skin regularly to detect any changes, such as new moles, changes in size or shape, or bleeding or itching. If you notice anything suspicious, contact your healthcare provider.</li>
                            <li>Get professional skin checks: Visit a dermatologist for a full-body skin check at least once a year. This can help detect any potential skin cancers, including melanoma, at an early stage when they are most treatable.</li>

                        <p> Vesicular skin lesions are nothing but blisters. They are small sacs filled with either clear or pus-colored fluid. They are typically 5-10mm in diameter. They are delicate and can burst due to pressure or friction. When a vesicle bursts, it becomes a vesicular eruption. Once they burst, the liquid spreads to the surrounding skin and leaves a white or yellow flaky crust when it dries.</p>
